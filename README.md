## 🛑 About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my Competitive Programming journey. It contains solutions from **50+ contests**, documenting my progress from beginner brute-force attempts to optimized algorithmic solutions.

**Primary Platform:** Codeforces
**Language:** Java

> **Note:** This is a raw progression log. Earlier solutions (e.g., `CodeForce_Round_672`) may lack optimal time complexity or strict naming conventions compared to recent Global Rounds.

## 📂 Navigation Structure
The repository is organized by **Contest Name**. 

**Naming Convention:**
Files in newer contests are named as `[Index]_[ProblemName].java` (e.g., `A_Sequence_Game.java`) to indicate the problem slot.

```text
├── Codeforces_Global_Round_30/
│   ├── A_Sequence_Game.java
│   ├── B_Even_Modulo_Pair.java
│   └── C_Dungeon.java
├── Codeforces_Round_672_Div2/
│   ├── Rock_and_Lever.java
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## 🛠️ Technology & Tools
* **Language:** Java (OpenJDK)
* **IDE:** VS Code / IntelliJ IDEA
* **Standard Input:** Solutions use standard `System.in` / `BufferedReader` for Fast I/O.

## 🚀 How to Run
Since these are standalone files, you can compile and run them individually.

**Using Terminal:**

1. Navigate to the contest folder:
   ```bash
   cd Codeforces_Global_Round_30 
   ```
2. Compile the solution:
   ```bash
   Compile the solution:
   ```
3. Run with input (manual entry or from file):
   ```bash
   java A_Sequence_Game
   ```
