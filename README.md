## 🛑 About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my Competitive Programming journey. It contains solutions from **50+ contests**, documenting my progress from beginner brute-force attempts to optimized algorithmic solutions.

**Primary Platform:** Codeforces
**Language:** Java

> **Note:** This is a raw progression log. Earlier solutions (e.g., `CodeForce_Round_672`) may lack optimal time complexity or strict naming conventions compared to recent Global Rounds.

## 📂 Navigation Structure
The repository is organized by **Contest Name**. 

**Naming Convention:**
Files in newer contests are named as `[Index]_[ProblemName].java` (e.g., `A_Sequence_Game.java`) to indicate the problem slot.
